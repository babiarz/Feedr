Project 2

• I used a generic thumbnail for the Reddit articles, since there were no thumbnails
• I was able to get most of the article to display in the pop-up iframe, but experienced the same problem you mentioned with some articles not working in iframes
• I included the link to my source article on the main page, not in the pop-up
• My error message will display if you click on "Cat News" in the drop down menu, since there is no cat news.
